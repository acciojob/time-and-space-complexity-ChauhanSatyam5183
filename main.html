	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It allows us to estimate the time required for running the algorithm. The goal is to achieve an efficient execution time for an algorithm.</p>
	<p>Space Complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the amount of memory used by an algorithm (including the input values to the algorithm) to execute and produce the result. In other words, how much is the increase in the space requirement of the algorithm with input? For instance, if we say Space complexity of an algorithm is O(n), it means that the memory required by the algorithm is proportional to the size of the input.</p>
